<h2>About SlickPad</h2>
<p>
SlickPad is a basic text editor which can be used for light programming. It supports Syntax highlighting and was a practice project which I made for Fun. SlickPad can do some basic functions like editing, saving and opening files. It has support for <b>Notifications</b>, which alert the user if the file hasn't been safed.

<h2>The Thought</h2>
<p>
The One and only reason to make SlickPad was to get rid of the old, boring text editor from Windows - <b>Notepad</b>. Though there were many alternatives, I wanted to do things by Myself, that was, to code an editor and to use it for my needs. Though SlickPad may not be the best, it makes me proud to say, that it certainly with this v2.8.0 surpassed Notepad in each aspect.

<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>
After the Success of Horizon, this project was just a coffee one, made for fun. I never intended to complete it though I feel that its pretty good now. In its Version 2.8.0, SlickPad might just break away. But the Future seems to be Bright, for I am aiming for Javafx Game Development. Feel free to download and edit the code.
