<h2>About SlickPad</h2>
<p>
SlickPad is a basic text editor which can be used for light programming. It supports Syntax highlighting and was a practice project which I made for Fun. SlickPad can do some basic functions like editing, saving and opening files. It has support for <b>Notifications</b>, which alert the user if the file hasn't been safed.

<h2>The Thought</h2>
<p>
The One and only reason to make SlickPad was to get rid of the old, boring text editor from Windows - <b>Notepad</b>. Though there were many alternatives, I wanted to do things by Myself, that was, to code an editor and to use it for my needs. Though SlickPad may not be the best, it makes me proud to say, that it certainly with this v2.8.0 ,surpassed Notepad in each aspect.

<h2>The Team</h2>
<h4>SlickPad wasn't built by a team of Coders, but two friends who today are proud to present before you SlickPad. Inspired by Javafx, I,Shashwat, started Building an app which could replace <b>Notepad In Windows</b>. I teamed up with Yash Hirani, and we both made SlickPad what it is today. Apart from the Graphics, Yash has played in important role in the spread of SlickPad. I started this project, and in the end, its much better than I would h've ever imagined. I thank the entire Javafx Community for helping me build this wonderful Project.

<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>
After the Success of Horizon(It won an award at CMS Lucknow), this project was just a coffee one, made for fun. I never intended to complete it, though I feel that its pretty good now. In its Version 2.8.0, SlickPad might just break away.But I won't shy in giving minor updates to its UI Though.
