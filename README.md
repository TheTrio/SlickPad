<h2>About SlickPad</h2>
<p>
When Programming was introduced in our high school, we still used notepad on the computers. Not only did notepad make us less productive, but it was very boring and failed to encourage the students. On the recommendation of our teachers, I started to create an editor which would not be too difficult for students to understand, but powerful enough to program in.

<h2>The Team</h2>
SlickPad wasn't built by a team of Coders, but two friends who today are proud to present before you SlickPad. Inspired by Javafx, I,Shashwat, started Building an app which could replace <b>Notepad In Windows</b>.I teamed up with Yash Hirani, and we both made SlickPad what it is today. Apart from the Graphics, Yash has played in important role in the spread of SlickPad. I started this project, and in the end, its much better than I would h've ever imagined.

<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>
After the Success of Horizon(It won an award at CMS Lucknow), this project was made for fun. I never intended to complete it, though I feel that its pretty good now. In its Version 2.8.0, SlickPad might just break away.But I won't shy in giving minor updates to its UI.
