### SlickPad - The Origin
SlickPad originated on 19 Ocotober 2016. I was sick and tired of our school computers using notepad as their default text editor, and while there were several alternatives, they were either too basic, or too complicated for school going students. So I decided to make an editor which perfectly fit the needs of our school. The result of this was SlickPad. 

### The Code
SlickPad is coded in Java 8. At some points, hints of batch scripting is used which makes this an only Windows app. SlickPad makes use of several public libraries like JFoenix, ControlsFx and RichTextFx. I would like to thank their creators for developing such awesome libraries. This Project is open to anyone, and everyone may contribute in it.
